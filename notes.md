# Notes: Tracko

## Purpose
My goal was to build a terminal-based app that helps track my expenses easily using Python.

---

## Code Flow (My Understanding)
- `'add'`: Adds an expense to the CSV file
- `'list'`: Shows all saved expenses
- `'total'`: Adds all expenses and prints the result

---

## What I Learned
- Working with CSV files using Python  
- Taking input from terminal with `sys.argv`  
- Writing functions for different commands  
- Structuring CLI-based programs  

---

## Future Improvements
- Delete entry by ID or category  
- Show expenses by category (e.g., how much spent on food)  
- Add validation for wrong input
