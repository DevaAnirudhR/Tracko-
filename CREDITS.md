# Credits

This project was created as part of my weekly code exploration challenge, in which I strive to fully understand and document one project each week.
 The concept was inspired by a variety of real-world command-line utilities and simple Python automation difficulties.
 I am grateful to the open-source community for making available information, tutorials, and code samples that helped define the logic and structure of this CLI tool.
